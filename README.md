# Spam Classification Model

## Introduction

This project implements a supervised learning model for classifying emails as spam or not spam (ham) based on their content. The model utilizes a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier with TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization for feature extraction.

## Features

- **TF-IDF Vectorization:** Converts text data into numerical features using the TF-IDF representation, capturing the importance of words in emails.
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier:** Uses a linear SVM classifier for binary classification of emails into spam or not spam categories.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Computes evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the model's performance.
